				<h1> Beyond Basic training <h1>
					<p> After obtaining you SIA licence, to be competitive as a close-protection officer you need to have additional experience. We have an intake 3 times a year in our facility in Romania which covers sniper training, hand to hand combat, weaponry, evasive car maneuvers on out track and and tailing skills in a city. We do 1 week sessions 2 times a year, and our Security Experts are pulled in from around the world as a Tiger Team to best train you. These are not individuals who "teach all the time". They are out in the field and give up their time in the field to run these week long sessions, which is why there are only 3 per year. Training at our secure facility in Romania. </p>
