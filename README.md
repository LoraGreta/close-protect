# Close-Protect Website

# Overview

### What is this website for?
 
This is an advertising website designed targeting individuals/groups who need specialized security protection and detail from an elite close protection and security company ("Triad Group Close Protection"). Triad Group was formed when three individuals with expertise in hand-hand combat, firearms, and tactical strategy) who have over 25 years of experience. These individuals worked multiple contracts together all over the world. These 3 individuals have come together to form one company to offer their services and to train the next generation of security experts. Triad Group services the UK (festivals, training base, and close protection of high net-worth individuals), the US (current contracts are with the NFL and other sporting events), Eastern Europe (transport of electronic shipments via Lorry and Ship), and South Africa (personal protection of government officials). 

 
### What does it do?
 
This website pulls my clientsâ€™ individual  specialties together and showcases their newly-founded company which offers multiple types of protection. My clients are three ex-military and ex-SAS individuals who came together to form a single security company. This company offers services ranging from close-protection of high net-worth individuals, to security detail at festivals, to escorting valuable electronic shipments through Europe. Other services offered are military survival training in Eastern Europe and Cane Corso estate/protection dogs for sale.
